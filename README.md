## Rule

* Place four black and white stones in the middle of the 8X8 grid.
* The stone can be placed only where it can surround the opponent's stone(s) in an eight-pronged direction.
* If there is no place to put the stone, the turn passes to the opponent.
* (Additional rule) At the start of the game, 5 spaces are randomly selected where no one can place a stone.
* The game ends in the following cases and the player with more stones wins.

  * When all 59 grids are filled with stones
  * If one side flips all of the opponent's stones
  * If neither side has anywhere to flip the stone

## Development Progress

* v1 (Present): Both black and white are controlled by the player.

  * Goal for next version: Implementing 'player vs. AI' function
